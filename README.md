# Python Scripts Extracted from Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains Python scripts (`cell_1.py` to `cell_6.py`) that were extracted from the Jupyter notebook `important2.ipynb`.

## Overview

The code is related to computational physics and astrophysical analysis. It includes:

- Data handling and numerical analysis
- Simulation setup and evaluation
- Plotting and visualization (likely using `matplotlib`)
- Possibly includes applications in:
  - Accretion flow modeling
  - Neutrino observatory data analysis
  - Black hole physics
  - High-energy astrophysical processes

## File Structure

- `cell_1.py` to `cell_6.py`: Code cells in sequence as they appeared in the original notebook.

Each script represents a part of a larger workflow and may depend on others (for example, for variable declarations or imports). It is recommended to run them in order if reconstructing the full process.

## Note

These scripts are meant for educational and research purposes in astrophysics and computational physics. Feel free to adapt them for your own study or analysis.
